# Xenforo Scraper

This is a Node-based Xenforo scraper for use by vaccine-lang. It shares a name
and goal with
[@qjroberts/xenforo-scraper](https://github.com/qjroberts/xenforo-scraper),
but it is not a fork of that project.

It is designed to run as Google Cloud Functions triggered by the Google
Scheduler, writing to a Cloud Datastore database.

As vaccine-lang continues to amass larger datasets, other, similar scrapers
will join this one.
